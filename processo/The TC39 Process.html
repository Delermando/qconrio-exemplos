<title>The TC39 Process</title>

</head><body><h1>The TC39 Process</h1>

<p>The Ecma <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm">TC39</a>
 committee is responsible for evolving the ECMAScript programming 
language and authoring the specification. The committee operates by 
consensus and has discretion to alter the specification as it sees fit. 
However, the general process for making changes to the specification is 
as follows.

</p><h2>Development</h2>

<p>Changes to the language are developed by way of a process which 
provides guidelines for evolving an addition from an idea to a fully 
specified feature, complete with acceptance tests and multiple 
implementations. There are four “maturity” stages. The TC39 committee 
must approve acceptance for each stage.

<p>* This column does not indicate a requirement for advancement, but simply a general expectation.

</p><h2>Input into the process</h2>

<p>Ideas for evolving the ECMAScript language are accepted in any form. 
Any discussion, idea or proposal for a change or addition which has not 
been submitted as a formal proposal is considered to be a “strawman” 
(stage 0) and has no acceptance requirements. Such submissions must 
either come from members of TC39 or from non-members who have <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/register_TC39_Royalty_Free_Task_Group.php">registered</a> via Ecma International.

</p><h2>Spec revisions and scheduling</h2>

<p>TC39 <em>may</em> submit for approval to the Ecma General Assembly a 
new Edition of the ECMAScript language in March and September of every 
year. Additions which have been accepted by the committee as “finished” 
(stage 4) <em>may</em> be included in a new Edition.

</p><h2>Status of in-process additions</h2>

<p>TC39 will maintain a list of in-process additions, along with the current maturity stage of each, <a href="https://github.com/tc39/ecma262">on its GitHub</a>.

</p><h2>Spec text</h2>

<p>At stages “draft” (stage 2) and later, the semantics, API and syntax 
of an addition must be described as edits to the latest published 
ECMAScript standard, using the same language and conventions. The 
quality of the spec text expected at each stage is described above.

</p><h2>Calls for implementation and feedback</h2>

<p>When an addition is accepted at the “candidate” (stage 3) maturity 
level, the committee is signifying that it believes design work is 
complete and further refinement will require implementation experience, 
significant usage and external feedback.

</p><h2>Reviewers</h2>

<p>Anyone can be a reviewer and submit feedback on an in-process 
addition. The committee should identify designated reviewers for 
acceptance during the “draft” (stage 2) maturity stage. These reviewers 
must give their sign-off before a proposal enters the “candidate” (stage
 3) maturity stage. Designated reviewers should not be authors of the 
spec text for the addition and should have expertise applicable to the 
subject matter. Designated reviewers must be chosen by the committee, 
not by the proposal's champion.

</p><h2>Eliding the process</h2>

<p>The committee may elide the process based on the scope of a change under consideration as it sees fit.

</p><h2>Role of the editor</h2>

<p>In-process additions will likely have spec text which is authored by a
 champion or a committee member other than the editor although in some 
case the editor may also be a champion with responsibility for specific 
features. The editor is responsible for the overall structure and 
coherence of the ECMAScript specification. It is also the role of the 
editor to provide guidance and feedback to spec text authors so that as 
an addition matures, the quality and completeness of its specification 
improves. It is also the role of the editor to integrate additions which
 have been accepted as “finished” (stage 4) into the a new revision of 
the specification.
